# Why Graph Neural Networks are Powerful

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool for processing data that is naturally structured as graphs, such as social networks, molecular structures, and knowledge graphs.

## What Makes GNNs Different?

Traditional neural networks operate on vectors, while GNNs extend this concept to graphs by considering the relationships between nodes.

### Key Applications

- **Social Networks**: GNNs can predict user behavior by analyzing the connections between people.
- **Drug Discovery**: In bioinformatics, GNNs help identify the most promising drug candidates by analyzing molecular graphs.
