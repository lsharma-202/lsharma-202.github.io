### [Understanding Graph Neural Networks with PyTorch Geometric](posts/pyg/understanding_gnn.md)
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of machine learning model designed to work with graph-structured data. They help capture relationships between data points by learning from the connections between them.

### [Ontologies — The Semantic way for Knowledge Representation](posts/sw/ontology_intro.md)
We don’t just store data — we connect ideas, define relationships, and build meaning. Ontologies provide the foundation to do this semantically, making knowledge both human-understandable and machine-readable.

### [Knowledge Graph Construction with Ontologies — Part 1](posts/sw/kg_construction.md)
We’ll use Protégé, a tool, to create a special structure — imagine it as a recipe for a MovieLens (EDA in my previous blog) dataset.
